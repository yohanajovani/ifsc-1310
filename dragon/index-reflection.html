    <h2>DRAGON PROJECT REVISION AND REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT</h2>

        <p>The thing that i did well on the project was targeting the element, 
            i use the flexbox in order to position them as well as styling the page and  creativity . To design a webpage for space x Dragon, what I would do differently if I were to start over, the website should be easy to navigate and provide visitors with clear and concise information about the dragon spacecraft and its missions.
          Some key elements that a web designer could include on a web page for spaceX dragon include:
        High-quality image of the spacecraft and its missions.
        Detailed description of the spacecraft’s specification and capabilities 
        Another thing I would do is consider incorporating more advanced technologies or features to make the website more engaging and informative. 
        Overall , the goal of designing a webpage for spacex Dragon is how much we learn about to create web design and apply what we learn on those. 
        The feedback i get from my peers was good and needed to be fix some stuffs like aligning the text, 
        add back -to-top scrolling  as well as the height the width of the image has to be same size which i did and i  didn’t notice but it was a good feedback </p>
