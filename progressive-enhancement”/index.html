      <p>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment 

        Progressive Enhancement is a web development approach that involves designing and building websites and web applications in layers, 
        starting with a solid foundation of basic functionality that is accessible to all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities, 
        and then progressively enhancing the user experience for users with more advanced devices or browsers.
    
        The basic idea is to create a website that works for everyone, regardless of the technology they are using, 
        and then add more advanced features and functionality for users with newer devices or browsers. This means that users with older or less advanced technology can still access and use the website, while users with newer technology can take advantage of more advanced features.
       
        Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web development because it allows developers to create websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their technology, while still providing a rich user experience for those with more advanced devices and browsers. 
        This approach ensures that users can access the content and functionality of the website, regardless of their device or browser, which is especially important for users with disabilities or limited access to technology.
        
        In addition, Progressive Enhancement allows developers to future-proof their websites, making them more resilient to changes in technology and ensuring that they will continue to work even as new technologies emerge.
        
        Here's a link to an article I found that provides a more detailed explanation of Progressive Enhancement and its importance in modern web development: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/
        
        Progressive Enhancement is a web development strategy that involves starting with a basic, functional version of a website and then adding more advanced features and functionality as the user's device or browser permits.
         This approach ensures that all users, regardless of their technology or ability, can access the core content and functionality of a website, while still providing a more enhanced experience for those with newer devices or browsers.
        
        This strategy is important in modern web development because it enables developers to build websites that are more inclusive and accessible to all users. 
        By designing with the core principles of Progressive Enhancement in mind, developers can create websites that are more resilient to changes in technology, more easily maintainable, and more future-proof.
        
        Progressive Enhancement also encourages a focus on web standards and semantic markup, which helps to ensure that websites are accessible to a wider range of users, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology.
        
        I found an article on A List Apart titled "Understanding Progressive Enhancement" that goes into more detail about the benefits and challenges of using this approach in web development.
         The article provides a comprehensive overview of the principles behind Progressive Enhancement and offers practical advice for developers looking to implement this strategy in their own work.
