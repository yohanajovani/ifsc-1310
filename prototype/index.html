      <h2>DRAGON PROJECT REVISION AND REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      
   </div>
     <p>The thing that i did well on the project was targeting the elements, i use the flexbox in order to position them as well as styling the page, add a header class and  creativity. To design a webpage for space x Dragon, what I would do differently if I were to start over, the website should be easy to navigate and provide visitors with clear and concise information about the dragon spacecraft and its missions.
      Some key elements that a web designer could include on a web page for spaceX dragon include:
    High-quality image of the spacecraft and its missions.
    Detailed description of the spacecraftâ€™s specification and capabilities 
    Another thing I would do is consider incorporating more advanced technologies or features to make the website more engaging and informative. Overall , the goal of designing a webpage for spacex Dragon is how much we learn about to create web design and apply what we learn on those. 
    The feedback I got from my peers was good and needed to fix some stuff like aligning the text, add back -to-top scrolling  as well as the height the width of the image has to be the same size which I did and the content of my webpage should be clear and informative. It should provide all the necessary information about the topic in an easy to -understand way. Make sure to include relevant images. The design of your webpage is also important. It should be visually appealing, easy to navigate and responsive to different screen sizes. Use a color scheme that is easy on the eyes and choose a font that is easy to read. Your webpage should function well, with all links and buttons working properly.
